      <paragraph>
        The first Vue.js London Conference was held at the former Olympic Press centre (Here East).
        Over 650 attendees got to experience a new standard for community conferences, with five new
        releases presented live on stage including the live release of Nuxt 2.0. Attendees gathered
        in huge break out areas to network, browse sponsor stands and indulge in fantastic food
        prepared by the official caterers for the 2012 Olympic Games IOC.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        Vue.js London was all about giving something back to the community, hopefully being a
        conference experience to remember. We had many highly regarded community members participate
        in making the 2018 edition an event to remember, with the likes of Sarah Drasner creating
        our landing page animation. We formed a huge brand presence that we wish to carry forward
        into our future events, with an iconic branding message
        <strong>code, create, communicate</strong> at the forefront.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        This conference was organised and delivered by a small team within an incredibly short
        period (3 months). We have a massive amount of thanks to anyone who volunteered or helped
        support the conference.

      <heading level="2" variant="block">Discovery</heading>
      <paragraph>
        Vue.js London is all about discovery and learning. We had new talks and workshop content,
        delivered by leading experts in the industry. We delivered a new type of conference learning
        aid, the Advice Lounge, where experts offered their expertise in a relaxed and open
        environment. We had Dan Abramov, a hugely fundamental community member in the web ecosystem
        particularly within the React space, attend and share his knowledge. The highly regarded
        Remy Sharp also participated in the advice lounge along with all the speakers and three
        highly regarded community members from the Vue.js community; Chris Fritz, Thorsten LÃ¼nborg
        and Damian Dulisz.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        We had <strong>over 26 leading experts</strong> from the Vue.js and surrounding communities.
        Sharing there expertise on the following topics: <strong>Vue</strong>,

      <heading level="2" variant="block">Diversity</heading>
      <paragraph>
        We adopted a diversity first approach, launching tickets and sponsorship deals to ensure
        that we could support the communities diversity. Our efforts didn't go unnoticed, with a
        large number of underrepresented individuals participating in the lineup or as an attendee.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        We had over 150 diversity applications, of those we managed to provide over 20% of the
        applicant's free tickets and provided all applicants a significant discount on tickets, with
        a further 20% taking the offer.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        From those that answered our after conference survey, 80.8% of those identifying they were
        from an underrepresented group felt like they had been fairly represented at our conference.
        With 7.7% believed they had at least been partially fairly represented. Although this is not
        perfect, we think that the efforts made for our first conference paid off, and we look
        forward to doing an even better job next year.

      <heading level="2" variant="block">Community</heading>
      <paragraph>
        We acquired the hugely popular Vue.js London meetup group where we will continue to invest
        in the community. We even spontaneously ran a last-minute pre-conference meetup at the
        Microsoft Reactor, which had one of the largest turnouts to date.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        Overall, the conference successfully brought together the Vue.js and surrounding
        communities. We provided them with a new and fresh conference experience.

      <heading level="2" variant="block">Learnings</heading>
      <paragraph>
        As with every conference, there are some key takeaways on what we can do better. We learnt
        many things from running our first conference, some of which will help us improve our future
        events and plan better.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        In the spirit of being transparent here are our takeaways from running the event and our
        actions.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        Budgets and overspending, we spent a significant amount on making Vue.js London an event to
        remember. However, there was an oversight in the budgets. As such we can do better to plan
        and budget, furthermore spending in the right areas to ensure that we get more out of our
        expenditure to give even more value to attendees.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        Timing, we came into the conference space last minute and launched one of the biggest UK
        developer conferences within only three months. This year we are giving ourselves much more
        time to plan and prepare.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        Video Recording. Unfortunately, we were unaware that we weren't quoted to have the talks
        recorded, only audio was recorded. This was a huge oversight on our behalf. Next year we
        will be sure to video record all the talks so that attendees have future material to
        reference.

      <heading level="2" variant="block">Next year</heading>
      <paragraph>
        We will be running the conference in 2019, and look forward to seeing some familiar faces.
        We will be applying any feedback received to the upcoming conference and all the great
        learnings from running the first year conference to make the future editions even better.
        With Vue 3.0 round the corner, Vue.js London 2019 will look to be one of the most crucial
        conferences to attend this year.
